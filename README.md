# Logseq Hackernews Feed Plugin
I open hackernews and logseq multiple times a day. Then why not combine them together. That was my thought process.  

## Setup
The project uses `pnpm` instead of `yarn` or `npm`.  
Install `pnpm` if you don't have it  
```bash
npm i -g pnpm
```

`cd` into the project root folder  
Then install the dependencies
```bash
pnpm install
```
To run the dev server
```bash
pnpm dev
```

To build 
```bash
pnpm build
```

## Things to keep in mind

Reload the plugin after each reload (save in vscode when pnpm dev is running)
